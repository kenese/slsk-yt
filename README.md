# slsk-yt

This is a node server whose goal is to talk to youtube and soulseek. There is also a browser component 
(in a private work repo at the moment)  and together their job is to read the youtube api for all my 
liked songs, get all the albums that have large number of likes (> than 3? 4? 5?) and download 
those albums as flacs from soulseek
